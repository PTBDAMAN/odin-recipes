    <img src="pork.jpg" alt="Foto de estofado de puerco">
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 bone-in pork chops, about 3/4-inch thick</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
        <li>2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken stock</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>fresh thyme sprigs for garnish (optional) </li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Blot chops dry with paper towels and season both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. When butter sizzles, add chops and brown on both sides, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Remove chops from the skillet and keep warm.</li>
        <li>To the same skillet, add remaining olive oil and butter. When butter is melted, add onions, mushrooms, and 1/2 teaspoon salt, and cook, stirring, until onions begin to turn translucent and mushrooms are softened, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add chicken stock, wine, and dried thyme, and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Return chops and any accumulated juices to the skillet, nestling chops down into vegetables and broth. Remove about 1/4 cup of broth for later use. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted near the center reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), 4 to 5 minutes. See note.</li>
        <li>Stir cornstarch into the reserved cooking liquid, and stir until there are no lumps. While stirring the skillet sauce, add cornstarch mixture, and continue stirring 3 to 4 minutes, or until the sauce thickens.</li>
        <li>Serve chops with mushrooms and sauce on top, and garnish with fresh thyme sprigs, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
